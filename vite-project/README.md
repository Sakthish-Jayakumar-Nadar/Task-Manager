# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Note* ==> First run (npm install) in the terminal
      ==> run (npm run dev) to start the application

In the utils folder there is data.js which act as mock data.
In this Application we have functionalities like delete, edit, mark as complete and add task.
All the action are not persist as there is no data base connectivity
